          Hi, my name is Gerald Salatnaya. I'm a web and game developer based in Manado, North Celebes. I build digital experiences that are as beautiful as they are functional. With a background in web and game development and a deep passion for visual art, I bring creativity and precision to every project â€” from designing intuitive user interfaces to developing full-stack applications that meet real-world business needs. <br><br>
          Art fuels my process. Whether I'm crafting immersive game environments or refining the flow of a website, I focus on clarity, usability, and visual impact. If you're looking for a developer who thinks like a designer and codes like an engineer, let's create something remarkable together.
